# thenextweb-clone
A  responsive clone of the website 'The Next Web'.

----
In this project, I set out to recreate The Next Web's homepage site which features several responsive breakpoints using media queries. Styling was created using purely vanilla CSS, positioning primarily with flex-box/grid, and icons from 'Font Awesome'.
